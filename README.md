# Hei ðŸ‘‹

The name's ahmad, a 19 year old student in Finland, and with an interest in software, performance and architecture.

### ðŸ“š Education & ðŸ’» Work

I am currently pursing 3 Bachelors degrees , which are
  - Electrical Engineering (primary, offline)
  - Computer Science (online)
  - Data Science & AI (online)

Currently, I am working on a few personal projects. I will post things relevant to it on (YouTube)[#] or my (Web Desktop)[#] as I progress further in them.

### Random things that interest me enough to put them here

- I really like to explore and talk in detail about architecture and system design
- I can grasp new concepts and adapt very quickly to my environment
- Started using Arch linux for the memes, ended using it until now (It's the best Linux derivative I've used)

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0x00ahmad) primarily if you want to talk about anything.
